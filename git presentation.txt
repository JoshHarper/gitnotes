Getting started with git

*What is git?*
**Git is a Distributed Version Control System(DVCS) created by Linus Torvald.  A DVCS is a type of version control that does not require a common network connection for collaboration.  This allows a developer to perform most basic operations of any version control system right in their own repository without the overhead of a network connection.

*To start using git the first thing we need to do is make sure you are identifiable.
*git config --global user.name "Josh Harper"
*git config --global user.email josh.harper@vocalocity.com
*This is your persona which is how git identifies who makes commits etc.

*Now we need to clone a repository in which you can make your own changes
* git clone git@github.com:JoshHarper/gitnotes.git
* There are many different URLs we can use to clone a repository. The above one uses SSH for authentication

*Now we are ready to make some changes to files. 
* After making changes files need to be staged for a commit
* Staging allows git to explictly say which changes we wish to be in the next commit
* git add [file]
* this command add an Unstaged file to the staging area in order to be commited
* You can see the status of what is currently not staged for a commit by running
* git status
* you can shotcut to add all items to the staging area with
* git add .

*Time to commit the changes we have made
* git commit
* As you can see a text editor will pop up and allow you to make a commit
* You can change this to any text editor you wish
(make another change)
* Here is a shortcut to make a commit without using a text editor for a message
* git commit -m "[msg]"
* you can skip over the staging area and commit unstaged files directly
* git commit -a


*Now that we have some commit changes let's take a look at the past history
* git log
* The above command looks at some commits made previously
* git log -3 -p
* This command shows 3 commits and the diff introduced in those commits.
* There are many additional options to pass to git log.


*Let's say you are creating a new feature
* A good thing to do is create a new branch
* git branch myNewFeature
* This command creates a branch from your current branch
* git branch
* This will list all branches you currently have locally
(possible questions for remote branches)
* git branch -v
*To start working on a branch you need to check it out
* git checkout [branchName]
* git status
* You can see we are now working on the branch we created
* Now you can continue to do work on the new branch you created
(shortcut for branching)
* git checkout -b [branchName]

*Now after finishing your work on a branch it's time to merge it back into a master branch
* git checkout master
* This command is used to switch us back into our master branch
* git merge [branchName]
* we have now merged our branch into the master
* We can now delete our branch since all our of changes are currently merged
* git branch -d [branchName]

*Now that we've made updates to your own repository let's see how git works with a central repository
* Let's get some changes for the origin
* git pull 
* This will pull down changes from your origin
* The performs a fetch will pulls down changes for an origin and then a merge between your master and the origin's master
* Origin is a keyword in git which means the place your cloned repository originated
* git remote
* This command will list the alias of all git remotes
* git remote -v 
* This command will list the URL and alias for all git remote accounts


*Now that you've synced with a central repository it's time to share your changes with others
* git push origin master
* This command will push your changes from your repository to your origin
(which is this case is github)
* you can push other branches as well
