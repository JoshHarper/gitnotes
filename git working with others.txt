==Git working with others==

*Setting up git remote
-- If you created repository via the git clone command there is not need to setup remote branches
-- If you wish to track a remote repository you can issue a command to add a new remote for you to track
(git command here) 


*Retrieving changes from a remote server*
-- Now that you setup a remote server to track you can fetch changes from that server
(git command here)
-- This will create a branch that is a local version of the remote branch usually named ${remoteRepo}/${branch}
-- If you wish to merge the changes into your own branch a git merge is needed
-- There is additional command you can issue which will do a git fetch and merge itself
(git command here)

*Getting your changes to a central server
-- At some point in time you will need to share your changes with others 
-- When sharing changes you will push an entire branch to the remote server
(git command here)

*Deleting a remote branch
-- Every now and then you will need to remove a branch from a remote server
(git command here)
-- This is good for cleaning up branches you have already merged and aren't needed to be tracked anymore
