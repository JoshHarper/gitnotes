Git intro presentation
* Develop a presentation that will go from creation of a local repository to a completed issue with a push.
* Need to make sure it's only an hour long
* Need to do a live demo as much as a power point presentation.
** Considering not doing an actual powerpoint presentation vs just a live demo.
** This will make the Confluence documents make much more sense.

Git flow presentation
* Power point presentation
** Make sure it's applicable to how people work correctly.
** Considering diluting in order to make sure the git migration is a bit less painless
** Very much consider this because we don't want it so diluted it defeats the purpose of gitflow.
